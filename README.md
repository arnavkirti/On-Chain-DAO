# On-Chain DAO Project

This on-chain DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) project was built using modern Web3 technologies, including NEXT.JS, Wagmi, Rainbow, Viem, Reown/Walletkit, and Foundry. The project consists of several smart contracts for managing NFTs and a decentralized marketplace for trading these NFTs.

## Project Overview

The project consists of three main components:

1. **CryptoDevsNFT** - A smart contract for minting and managing CryptoDevs NFTs.
2. **FakeNFTMarketplace** - A marketplace for trading the CryptoDevs NFTs.
3. **CryptoDevsDAO** - A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for governance and decision-making.

### Key Features:
- **NFT Minting**: Users can mint CryptoDevs NFTs.
- **Marketplace**: A decentralized marketplace to buy and sell CryptoDevs NFTs.
- **DAO Governance**: DAO smart contract for community voting and decision-making.

## Smart Contracts

The following smart contracts are deployed on the blockchain:

1. **CryptoDevsNFT**:
   - Contract address: `0x91950ca3db93577C8811741044b5bd5d5f800C54`

2. **FakeNFTMarketplace**:
